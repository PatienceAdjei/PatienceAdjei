Hi, I’m Patience Adjei!
👀 I’m interested in data analytics, finance, business analysis, and operations management.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL, data visualization techniques with Power BI and Tableau, and applying business analytics in real-world projects.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, especially for nonprofits or startups, where I can contribute my skills in business analysis and visualization.
